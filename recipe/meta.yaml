  summary: 'Modular data acquisition and analysis framework'
  description: |
    QCoDeS is a Python-based data acquisition framework developed 
    by the Copenhagen / Delft / Sydney / Microsoft quantum computing 
    consortium. While it has been developed to serve the needs of 
    nanoelectronic device experiments, it is not inherently limited 
    to such experiments, and can be used anywhere a system with many 
    degrees of freedom is controllable by computer.
